# Final_Proposal


Description

This will be a "choose your own adventure" story with multiple paths, at least one boss battle, and two different endings.
This will be achieved by giving the player 2 options per round and battles will be done using random dice rolls, similar to DND.


Features

I plan to include random number generators to attack the boss as well as weapon inventories using lists in order to choose different weapons.
I also want to implement several choices for the player to make in order to create different paths.


Challenges

I think a challenge in itself is limiting my ideas so I'm able to create a fully functional game in the time provided.
Additionally, getting several different paths to work and keeping track of each one will be a large time commitment.



Outcomes

My biggest goal is to create a combat system that works with multiple weapons that have different damage.
My other outcome goal is to create a cohesive story that is engaging to the player.


Milestones

My first milestone will be to write out the paths I want to use. 
Next will be to create the lists of weapons and where they will be acquired. 
Then, I will code each path.
Finally, I will code the battle simulator and write the ending.
